# libft
### 42 - Project #1

### From the PDF

C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project makes you to take the time to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn how to use them. This library will help you for all your future C projects.

Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions with your own. Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year.

For the complete instructions, check out the [PDF].

### Usage

Build the library by running

	make

After that, a libft.a will be created. Now you can compile files using the library like this:

	gcc -o filename filename.c /path/to/libft.a
	./filename
